Class Checkbox
	A check box is a graphical component that can be in either an "on" (true) or "off" (false) state. Clicking on a check box changes its state from "on" to "off," or from "off" to "on."

Alternatively, several check boxes can be grouped together under the control of a single object, using the CheckboxGroup class. In a check box group, at most one button can be in the "on" state at any given time. Clicking on a check box to turn it on forces any other check box in the same group that is on into the "off" state.
