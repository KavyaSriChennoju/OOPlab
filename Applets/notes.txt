Java applets:
	A Java applet is a compiled Java program, composed of classes just like any Java program. While a simple applet may consist of only a single class, most large applets should be broken into many classes.

Applets are autonomous programs, but they are confined within the walls of a web browser or applet viewer, and have to play by its rules.

{
An applet is more like an embeddable program module. The Java interpreter can't run an applet directly, because it is used as part of a larger application. To run an applet, you can use a web browser like Sun's HotJava or Netscape Navigator, or the appletviewer tool that comes with the SDK.

Both HotJava and appletviewer are standalone Java applications run directly by the Java interpreter; these programs implement the additional structure needed to run Java applets.

The applet ran with security restrictions that prevented the applet from doing questionable things like reading from or writing to the disk or contacting arbitrary computers on the network.

Developing an applet
	1. import the neccessary packages
		java.applet.*;
		javax.swing.*;
	2. create a class by extending Applet class (for AWT) /JApplet class (for Swings).
	3. save the file .java extension.
	4. compile the .java file by using the javac.exe
	5. create a html file by using the 
		<APPLET> tag
	6. save the HTML file either in .html or in .htm
	7. execute the .html/.htm file in the web-browser/ appletviewer.
