Varargs:
	In past releases, a method that took an arbitrary number of values required you to create an array and put the values into the array prior to invoking the method.

It is still true that multiple arguments must be passed in an array, but the varargs feature automates and hides the process.

public static String format(String pattern,Object... arguments);

The three periods after the final parameter's type indicate that the final argument may be passed as an array or as a sequence of arguments. Varargs can be used only in the final argument position.
