d:\j2sdk1.4.0\lib 
	Files used by the development tools. These include tools.jar, which contains non-core classes for support of the tools and utilities in the SDK. 

d:\j2sdk1.4.0\jre 
	The root directory of the Java runtime environment used by the SDK development tools. The runtime environment is an implementation of the Java 2 platform. 

d:\j2sdk1.4.0\src.jar 
Archive containing source code for the Java 2 platform. 

d:\j2sdk1.4.0\demo 
	Examples, with source code, that show you how to program for the Java platform. 

d:\j2sdk1.4.0\include 
	C-language header files that support native-code programming using the Java Native Interface(JNI) and the Java Virtual Machine Debugger Interface. 

d:\j2sdk1.4.0\bin 
	The executable files for the development tools contained in the Java Development Kit. The PATH environment variable should contain an entry for this directory.


	(Basic Tools)

javac: 	
The compiler for the Java programming language. 
   (java source code - to -Byte code).
	.java   -> .class
java 
    	 The launcher for Java applications. 

jar 	
 Manage Java Archive (JAR) files. (java Executable file .jar)

jdb	 The Java Debugger. 

javah:
	C header and stub generator. Used to  write native methods. (JNI ->java Native interface)

javap: 
Class file disassembler(displays source to the given .class file )

appletviewer:
	 Run and debug applets without a web browser.

javadoc:  You can use it to generate the API (Application Programming Interface) documentation or the implementation documentation for a set of source files.

The JavadocTM tool parses the declarations and documentation 	comments in a set of Java source files and produces a corresponding 	set of HTML pages describing (by default) the public and protected 	classes, nested classes (but not anonymous inner classes), interfaces, 	constructors, methods, and fields.
